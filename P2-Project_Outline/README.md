### Overview
The biggest hurdle of Nonprofit work with smaller operating budgets is the lack of technology and the overwhelming cost of software to track data. Without manipulating the data, there is not a clear, defined method focusing on necessary elements for optimization. Optimization would be defined as successfully reducing the overpopulation and suffering of community cats through spay/neuter in heavily populated locations.

As the Vice President of St Louis Feral Cat Outreach, my organization receives CSB’s (Citizen Service Bureau) complaints relative to stray and community cats in the City of St Louis. These reports consist of locations where stray/community cats tend to congregate, which can also be known as colonies of cats. What I would like to do is focus on is collecting and tracking this data via user interface so specific locations can be targeted for TNR (trap-neuter-return). Once intended targets have been completed, the user would be able to mark the location as such. This data will also be a vital tool for presentation re: grant writing, capital campaigns, etc.

### Features
-	User login – Due to the application working with sensitive data, a user login will be required to view or add data. 
-	Search features – User will be able to search via location and/or CSB complaint #.
-	Create / edit / delete / add notes – Users will create new CSB’s. 
-	Mapping – Each complaint will be mapped individually and be added to a master mapping file.
